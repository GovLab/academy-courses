          <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3><span>The first years of the 21</span><span class="c12">st</span><span>&nbsp;century have been characterized by seemingly intractable global challenges. Huge, complex problems, from climate change to global inequality, threaten the stability of our economies, the health of the planet and the human race itself. We have looked to traditional societal institutions to tackle these problems, and we have been frustrated by their inability to act effectively and legitimately. People are increasingly angry about political systems where every day is Election Day, campaigning has a higher priority than problem-solving, and political expediency seems to take precedence over the public interest. As a result, trust in existing institutions is at an all-time low. </span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>To solve today&rsquo;s complex problems, from climate change to economic inequality, we will need innovation in the very design of our democratic institutions. In our current model of government, an elite group of elected and appointed leaders is supposed to solve critical problems largely on their own, without significantly engaging the insights, experience, and brainpower of the people they represent. Moreover, our systems of government have failed to use the new tools and technologies that have been successfully applied in other arenas including the private sector. Consider:</span></p></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_c853bs2djhvm-0 start"><li class="c5"><span>Technology has lowered the cost and ease of communication, yet we still have an 18</span><span class="c12">th</span><span>&nbsp;century model of representative democracy where participation is limited to occasional voting and affords few opportunities for people to participate in governing.</span></li><li class="c5"><span>Technology enables diverse experts with different skills and experience to work together, across a distance, yet we still have a 19</span><span class="c12">th</span><span>&nbsp;century model of centralized and professional bureaucracy.</span></li><li class="c5"><span>Research demonstrates that people can and will collaborate in purposeful groups on- and off-line, yet we still have a political culture dominated by entrenched parties and deep pockets that treats a talented public as outsiders and impedes collaboration.</span></li><li class="c5"><span>The private sector is increasingly embracing data-driven experimentation and collaboration with customers and suppliers, yet our governing institutions are still bounded by legal rules and policies that prohibit rapid experimentation.</span></li></ul><p class="c6 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Groundbreaking technological advances, together with new social science research on collaboration, have inspired many to reexamine how we make decisions and solve problems. For example, the U.S. and UK governments have released open data for public use leading to path-breaking new tools; the U.S. federal government has used prizes and challenges to spur innovative approaches to solving problems; and 1500 cities around the world have instituted participatory budgeting to give citizens direct control over some public funds to limit corruption and improve how we govern.</span></p><p class="c6"><span>This shift from top-down, closed government to decentralized, open and smarter governance may become a major social innovation in the 21</span><span class="c12">st</span><span>&nbsp;century. Yet we still know very little about what works when, why, and under what conditions. </span></p>


          <h3>COURSE GOALS</h3><span>TO BEGIN TO DEVELOP THE MINDSET AND THE SKILLSET TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO PUBLIC PROBLEMS.</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Gov 3.0 is aimed at those who want to develop a specific social good project for which they want to build the skills to move it closer to implementation. &nbsp;The course targets the &quot;purpose driven learner&quot; -- the person with a topic about which they are passionate -- who wants to expand her toolkit for social change. Group projects are strongly encouraged.</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>The syllabus is designed to expose you to a new skill and have you teach yourself how to apply it to the topic you are passionate about. We have the daunting task of teaching ourselves something about technology and something about law &amp; policy and how to combine them effectively to translate good ideas into implementable action.</span></p>

          <h3>COURSE OUTPUTS</h3><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>You will develop a project and a plan for its implementation, including a long and short description, a slide deck, a persuasive video and project blog.</span></p>

          <h3>PREREQUISITES</h3><span>Intellectual curiosity and a willingness to experiment are essential for this course. No formal technology training are assumed or required but an interest in and willingness to play with new tools will be.</span></p>

          <h3>READINGS</h3><span>All readings will be freely available on the open web or distributed during class. For additional reading on the topics of the course, there are four books I recommend acquiring: Beth Noveck,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Wiki Government</span><span>&nbsp;(2009) which is also freely available from the library as an eBook </span><span class="c2"><a class="c8" href="http://ezproxy.library.nyu.edu:2054/lib/nyulibrary/docDetail.action?docID=10338483">Wiki Government Electronic Version</a></span><span>; Steven Johnson, </span><span class="c1">Future Perfect </span><span>(2012); Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, </span><span class="c1">Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness </span><span>(2010); and Laurel Ruma, ed., </span><span class="c1">Open Government</span><span>&nbsp;(2010) (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c8" href="https://github.com/oreillymedia/open_government">link</a></span><span>) (freely available online).</span></p>

          <h3>TWITTER</h3></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gov30">#gov30</a> </span><span>is the class hashtag</span></p><p class="c6 c9"><span></span></p>

          <h3>OTHER STUFF ABOUT CLASS</h3><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_lnoco4g3squa-0 start"><li class="c5"><span class="c4">In Class: </span><span>Students will attend and participate actively. Because lectures will be online and watched prior to class, class time will be used for conversations, demonstrations, and design problems. Attendance at all classes, given our limited time together, is mandatory: if you must be absent, let Beth and Mehan know in advance.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c4">Presenting Early and Often</span><span>: During the course of the term, we will work together to develop an approach to tackling the problem you are passionate about. We want to learn to develop projects that are high impact and yet practical to implement and to avoid inventing or reinventing wheels. Hence you will be asked to identify your problem and solution very early and constantly refine it throughout the semester through iterative presentations.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c4">Speakers</span><span>: We will have cool and interesting visitors through the semester to enliven our discussions and offer additional coaching and mentoring. Speakers will be announced prior to class and the syllabus will be updated with their bios and presentation materials where relevant.</span></li></ul>

          <h3>ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING</h3><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_bqwo4mgieea1-0 start"><li class="c5"><span>Project Plan (40%)</span></li><li class="c3"><span>Long Description</span></li><li class="c3"><span>Two Page Memo</span></li><li class="c3"><span>Presentation Deck</span></li><li class="c3"><span>Video</span></li><li class="c5"><span>Project Blog (40%)</span></li><li class="c5"><span>Informed, Class Participation (20%)</span></li></ul><p class="c6 c9"><span></span></p><p class="c6"><span>All your work will be iterative. We will repeatedly design, present, revise, enabling you to finish the course with vetted writing samples. I expect that you will tweet, live blog and/or blog out of class. Postings are not letter graded. </span><span>You will submit one posting to me in the first half of the semester, which I will edit and you will revise and republish before the end of the semester.</span></p>

These types of initiatives largely fall into one of two categories: prizes and grand challenges. As budgets tighten and information and communication technologies continue to advance, leveraging the expertise of the public through contests and challenges is becoming more attractive to government agencies. While there are differences between the two techniques, both shift the locus of innovation from inside a government agency to the public, while creating motivation beyond basic market incentives.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c4">Reading: </span><span>Darren Brabham, Moving the Crowd at iStockPhoto (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c8" href="http://pear.accc.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2159/1969">link</a></span><span>); Tom Kalil and Cristin Dorgelo, &ldquo;Identifying Steps Forward in Use of Prizes to Spur Innovation,&rdquo; White House Blog: Office of Science and Technology Policy, April 10, 2012 (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c8" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/04/10/identifying-steps-forward-use-prizes-spur-innovation">link</a></span><span>) OSTP Memo on Prizes and Challenges, Department of Health and Human Services (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c8" href="http://www.hhs.gov/open/initiatives/challenges/ostp_memo.html">link</a></span><span>); &ldquo;&lsquo;And the winner is&hellip;&rsquo; Capturing the promise of philanthropic prizes,&rdquo; McKinsey &amp; Company, July 2009 (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c8" href="http://mckinseyonsociety.com/downloads/reports/Social-Innovation/And_the_winner_is.pdf">link</a></span><span>)</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c4">Watching: GovLab Academy resources on Crowdsourcing Expertise (<a href="http://www.thegovlabacademy.org/crowdsourcing/expertise/">VIDEOS</a>); </span><span>Video: Tom Kalil (link) and Cristin Dorgelo (</span><span class="c2"><a class="c8" href="http://www.casefoundation.org/collaborative-innovation">VIDEO: Collaborative Innovation</a></span><span>)</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c4">Skills Share: From Idea to Implementation</span></li></ul><ul class="c7 lst-kix_n4lgzawr91jp-1 start"><li class="c3"><span>In Class - Lecture from Rudi Borrmann, Buenos Aires city government</span></li><li class="c3"><span>After Class - Design your test cases; refine your presentation</span></li></ul><p class="c6 c9"><span></span></p>

             <h4>April 16th - CLASS 11 - Open Data Governance: Open Government Data</h4>&nbsp;<ul class="c7 lst-kix_sgs1tm9d6uqk-0 start"><li class="c5"><span class="c4">Introduction: </span><span>Governing produces a lot of data. Governments generate, collect and compile vast amounts of digitized data continually through activities such as collecting vital statistics, administering the tax system, recording government operations activity, managing public infrastructure and natural resources, surveying and recording public and private lands, processing regulatory requirements and managing social service delivery. Add to this flood of new digital data the large stock of previously collected data &ndash; stored in warehouses and filing cabinets in non-digital forms and archaic computer systems &ndash; and the challenges of governing in a complex environment don&rsquo;t seem to reside in a lack of data. Rather, the challenge seems to be how to convert data into usable information, and how to apply knowledge to the interpretation of that information. Over the last few years, in the U.S., the United Kingdom and a growing number of other countries, the drive to open up more government data has become a national priority. Not only federal agencies, but state and local governments too are releasing more data in open formats to make their operations more transparent, bring information on government services to the public, and fuel new data-driven businesses. In this class, we explore how institutions and networks are collaborating to solve problems using newly available open government data. We discuss what is open government data and how it might lead to innovative solutions. </span></li>

Many institutions remain unsure of how new tools and more data will help them achieve their missions. When combined with doubts about the legal permissibility of consulting with outside experts, publishing data freely and online, or devolving power, law and policy can contribute to a resistance to institutional innovation. As a result, collaborative platforms are often used merely as tools for broadcasting messages to the public, rather than for their full potential of co-creating solutions. In particular, significant American legislation and regulation developed before the current era of network technologies is a significant constraint on governing institutions&rsquo; ability to leverage citizen-engagement in the digital age. In this session, we survey some of the legal, policy and cultural barriers to innovations in governance.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c4">Reading: </span><span>GovLab Memo (TBD)</span><span class="c4">; </span><span>Further reading on legal and policy barriers to opening governance: Jeffrey D.
